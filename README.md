CPA Attack to Embedded AES Algorithm

## Description
University project for **HSES** (Hardware Security in Embedded Systems, Primitives, Weaknesses and Countermeasures) subject of UPC Master's of Cibersecurity.

The goal of the project is to implement a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack to the 128-bit
AES encryption algorithm and retrieve the 16 bytes of the key.
